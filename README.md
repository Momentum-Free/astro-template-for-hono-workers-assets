# Astro Starter Kit: Basics + Hono on Cloudflare Workers with Static Assets

As Astro template to run on Cloudflare Workers: with Assets for SSG and a Hono backend for API requests.

This repo serves as a base for anyone who wishes to build a website using the new [Cloudflare Workers with Static Assets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/static-assets/) capabilities (to replace Cloudflare Pages websites), with [Hono](https://hono.dev/docs/getting-started/cloudflare-workers) as the framework for the backend and [Astro](https://astro.build/) for the frontend.
